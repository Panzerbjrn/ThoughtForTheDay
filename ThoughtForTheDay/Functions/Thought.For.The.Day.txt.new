I don't think there's any difference between the pope wearing a large hat and parading around with a smoking purse, and an African painting his face white and praying to a rock. - Howard Stern
At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality. - Che Guevara
Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blindfolded fear. - Thomas Jefferson
It is individuals who have human rights, not religions or beliefs. To give the latter legal protection would severely curb the individual's right to freedom of expression - as already happens in some Muslim countries, where people of other faiths need to tread very carefully. - Ian Harris
Shepherds don't look after sheep because they love them - although I do think some shepherds like their sheep too much. They look after their sheep so they can, first, fleece them and second, turn them into meat. That's much more like the priesthood as I know it. - Christopher Hitchens (1949 - 2011)
I can't say that it's the Koran that causes a husband to beat his wife, but when I was a translator in Holland and we condemned some men for beating their wives, they would pull out the Koran and say, 'Look here, Chapter 4, Verse 34, gives me a reason, and in fact even obligates me, to beat my wife if she's disobedient.' - Ayaan Hirsi Ali
By all means let an observant Jewish adult male have his raw-cut penis placed in the mouth of a rabbi. By all means let grown women who distrust their clitoris or their labia have them sawn away by some other wretched adult female. But the conscription of the unprotected child for these purposes is something that even the most dedicated secularist can safely describe as a sin. - Christopher Hitchens
Knowledge is a Continuum. - Magnus The Red.
Blood cannot be soaked up by bread. - Kolo, Imperial Fists
Anger is a blindfold; a fools motivation. - Shadrak Meduson

There is nothing to be gained by feeding hungry ghosts. - Commander Puretide
Ignorance is a shield almost as strong as faith in the throne. - Ciaphais Cain
Let the motive force castigate the heretek and the experimenter. - Taghmata Dominata
Follow up a victory by striking quickly, and you will win another - Commander Puretide
Curiosity is an infection to be quarantined, and dashed against the rocks of duty. - Dark Angels
Power has no limits. Every morsel of power engenders more hunder; it is never satisfied. - Rogal Dorn
There is always more to know, more to learn; And every act of learning must come with the knowledge that it is never enough. - Magnus the Red
Learn to shorten your reach. If your foe can come close enough to negate your striking power, all strategem is lost. And when all strategem is lost, the battle is lost. - O'Shovah
The pursuit of knowledge rivals the pursuit of beauty in its arrogance; both quests are borne of hubris, yet of the two the sin of curiosity cuts deeper and leaves the greater wound. - Sermons of Sebastian Thor
